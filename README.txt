# 04 April 2016 Algorithms + Photos = art
rough plan (maybe use shapecollage for letters):

1. Show the art
2. Show the photos
3. Show the algorithms
4. Show the narration

Along the way mention narrating your work, using a glue language and have fun!

## PROGRESS 30 March 2016
1. [3000 shapecollage photos processed by gm convert from png to jpg](https://github.com/rtanglao/algosplusphotosequalsart/blob/master/photos%20%2B%20algos%20%3D%20art%20auto%2034233%20x%203540.jpg) ([better version on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/26120401556/))
